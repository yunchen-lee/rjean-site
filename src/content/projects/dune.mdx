### 光影織物 Threads of Light and Shadow


數位運算結合傳統梭織的技法，將真實世界中的光影拆解，並以程式重構成虛構的織物，再現瞬間的光影印象，以深色的經紗作為影子，淺色的緯紗是光線，上下交錯的經緯紗線創造的畫面中的明暗對比。此作品以布面上複層油墨的堆疊重現編織物的立體感，將當下空間中照映在織物上的光影疊合在畫面中。

Digital computation combines traditional weaving techniques to deconstruct the interplay of light and shadow in the real world, reimagining it as fictional textiles that capture fleeting impressions. Dark warp threads represent shadows, while light weft threads embody light. The interweaving of these threads creates a striking contrast of light and dark in the composition. This artwork recreates the three-dimensionality of woven fabric through layered ink on canvas, superimposing the dance of light and shadow from the surrounding space onto the image.
